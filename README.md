# Death Stranding 2: Cargo Simulator UI Demo

This project is a simplified demo of the cargo simulator UI from the game Death
Stranding 2: On The Beach. It is not a perfect 1:1 replica of the original
content.

I developed this demo as a study project to learn 3D programming using React and
ThreeJS (React Three Fiber).

  then builds the production app with Vite.
- `npm preview`: Previews the production build locally.
